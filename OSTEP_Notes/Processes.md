# Processes and Processes API

## 4.1 The process abstraction

A process is the name that we call to the abstraction created by the OS to a program
The process has a part of the memory that can address(address space), special registers like a program counter(PC) and stack pointer(manages the address space related to stack), I/O information, etc 

## 4.2 Process API

* Create()
* Destroy()
* Wait() //for I/O
* Status()
* MiscellaneousControl() //Example: Suspend and resume process

## 4.3 Process Creation

1. The program content from the disk is loaded into memory
2. The stack is allocated
3. The heap is (de)allocated when needed by malloc() and free()
4. File descriptors for I/O are initialized
5. The OS starts to the entry point of the program, main() and transfers the control to the CPU

## 4.4 Process states

3 different states:
* Running
* Ready -> waiting for the decision to run by the scheduler
* Blocked -> waiting for I/O

Example:
Ready->Running->Blocked(by I/O)->(I/O done)Ready->Running....

## 4.5 Data structures in the scheduler

The OS keeps track of information about the processes(Process list) so it can decide which process should run, save the information when the scheduler decides to run other process, know the state of a given process,etc.
When the process ends other process or the OS will check if it executed sucessfully and if so it will clear the information about the extinct process

## 5.1 The fork() system call

Acts as an entry point into the program that is running at the time creating a process that is an almost exact copy of the process that called him with its own memory address, process ID and registers. 
Even though the process is a copy the entry point it's not main() but fork()!
To distinguish the parent and child processes we can use the return value of fork()-> PID if parent,0 if child
If we don't use wait() the scheduler can choose which process will run first!
*NOTE:*
Use getpid() to get the PID of the process running at the time!

## 5.2 The wait() system call
